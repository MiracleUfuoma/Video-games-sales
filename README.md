**ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES**:
 Examine sales trends
Identify successful genres
Identify successful gaming platforms

**INTRODUCTION**:
I analyzed a video games dataset spanning from 1980 to 2020. The main goals were to pinpoint the region with the highest sales, the most successful genre, and the top 5 platforms with the highest sales.

**DATA AND METHODOLOGY**:
•	Obtained the dataset from Kaggle, comprising 16 columns including Name, Platform, Year of Release, Genre, Publisher, Sales in North America (NA), Japan (JP), Europe (EU), Global, Other regions, Critic Score, Critic Count, User Score, User Count, and Rating.
•	Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
•	Noted missing values from 1980-1993 due to the absence of standardized platforms or online databases for user scores or reviews. Online databases became prevalent in 1994.

**ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS**:
•	Explored the global sales trend over the years (line chart).
•	Examined sales distribution by genre (bar chart).
•	Investigated the top-selling platforms and their performance (bar chart).
•	Evaluated the top-selling games by region (pie chart).
•	Noteworthy was a surge in game sales in 2008, attributed to the introduction of new hardware products, resulting in a 19% increase in video game sales.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
Consider collaborations with successful game developers, particularly in popular genres like action.
Given North America's leading position in video game sales, there's an opportunity to capitalize on this market by increasing game sales in the region.
